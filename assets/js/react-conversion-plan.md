### Comprehensive Plan for Converting HTML and JavaScript Code into React

#### Information Gathered:
- The existing JavaScript code handles various functionalities such as:
  - Toggling the sidebar.
  - Displaying testimonials in a modal.
  - Managing custom select inputs and filtering items.
  - Validating a contact form.
  - Navigating between different pages.

#### Plan:
1. **Create a React Application**: Set up a new React application if not already done.
2. **Component Structure**:
   - **Sidebar Component**: Handle the sidebar toggle functionality.
   - **Testimonials Component**: Manage the display of testimonials and modal functionality.
   - **Custom Select Component**: Implement the custom select input with filtering capabilities.
   - **Contact Form Component**: Handle form validation and submission.
   - **Navigation Component**: Manage page navigation and active link highlighting.
3. **State Management**: Use React's `useState` hook to manage the state for toggles, form inputs, and selected values.
4. **Event Handling**: Replace direct DOM manipulation with React event handlers.
5. **Styling**: Ensure that the existing CSS styles are applied to the new components.

#### Follow-up Steps:
- Verify the functionality of each component.
- Test the overall application to ensure all features work as expected.
